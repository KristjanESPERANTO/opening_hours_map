# opening_hours_map

[opening_hours](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:opening_hours) tag is used in [OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.org) project to describe time ranges when a specific facility (for example, a cafe) is open.

This map shows the opening_hours as nicely readable time table.

# Credits
Big thanks goes to Netzwolf how created some OpenLayers extensions and [examples][]. He also created the same map showing opening\_hours with his JS implementation (which is withdrawn in favour of opening\_hours.js). Big parts of his code are still in use. Although most code around the opening\_hours interpretation was rewritten.
